						<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
						<p>
							Brewtorial is a web based application designed to let experienced Brewers post step by step recipes for interested amateurs to follow so that they may create their own delicious craft beers. Recipes consist of in depth instructions combined with timers so that a user can have confidence their home brew is up to a high standard. For the longer steps a user's recipe stage is saved so they may return and check on the status of their home brew.
